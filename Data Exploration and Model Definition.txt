15.2: Data Exploration and Model Definition:-

Lariat’s business objective: To make better business decisions by minimizing the cost and maximizing the revenue.
Four data sheets are provided here. Apart from that a few more variables are required to design the model. Explanations of those variables are given below:
Variable 	Table 	Usage
Price per booking	car_revenue	It is the revenue generated per booking of a car.
No. of times rented	Branch_location	No. of times cars are rented from a branch.
Revenue per branch	Branch_location	Revenue generated from each branch.
Accident_indicator	Branch_location	Total no. of cars meets with an accident from a branch.
Car_make/model	Calculations 1	It will show a combined value of car make and car model.
car_cost_yearly 
	Calculations 1	It will provide the rent paid by Lariat per year for a car.
car_insurance_yearly 
	Calculations 1	It will provide the insurance paid by Lariat per year for a car.
car_cost_total 
	Calculations 1	It is the rent plus insurance paid by Lariat per year for a car.
Car_revenue_yearly 
	Calculations 1	It is the revenue generated by Lariat per year for a car.
Car_profit_yearly 
	Calculations 1	It is the net revenue generated by Lariat per year for a car.
rented_length_per_year
	Calculations 1	It is the total length of the rent for a car per year.
No. of times rented
	Calculations 1	It is the total no. of times the car is rented per year.
No. of accidents per year
	Calculations 1	It is the total no. of times a car meets accident per year.


In this model, I decided to implement three strategies, keeping in mind Lariat’s business objective.
Strategy 1: Adding 10% extra cars to maximize the revenue.
Strategy 2: Increase the rent by 10%.	
Strategy 3: Combine two strategies (strategy 1 and Strategy 2).
